## Website showing Covid-19 data globally

The Covid-19 data and population number are sourced from https://covid19-api.org and https://restcountries.eu respectively.

This project was first intended to focus solely on Covid-19 cases in Malaysia (hence the repo & website name) but eventually expanded to include all countries due to the availabity of free and reliable public API. 

Graphs and charts are plotted using <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/">amCharts</a>

Styling is done by using a Bootstrap template named Octopus. (<a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/free-html5-admin-dashboard-templates/"> found here </a>)

The website is deployed using gh-pages. https://zahidyew.github.io/msia-covid19/
